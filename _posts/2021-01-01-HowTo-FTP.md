FTP is interactive and needs you to supply credentials when prompted

you can't exactly pipe in FTP creds with a command line option, but what you can do is redirect stdin like so:

```yaml
$ ftp -n ftp.backupte4.rsyncbackup.info << EOF
> quote USER bapte
> quote PASS b2p7Ua2
> put somefile  <-- this is the command you want to execute
> quit
> EOF
```

or you can put it in a script:

```yaml
#!/bin/sh
ftp -n ftp.backupte4.rsyncbackup.info << EOF
quote USER bapte
quote PASS b2p7Ua2
put somefile
quit
EOF
```
