## Installing Impacket on Kali Linux 2020

Here are my notes to make a successful install of Impacket on Kali Linux version 2020. These were taken from tryhackme.com
Step by step commands to run in terminal:

1. First install python 3:

```yaml
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

2. Next clone the repo to the /opt folder on root of kali:

```yaml
sudo git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git /opt/impacket
```

3. Then install any requirements not already present:

```yaml
sudo pip3 install -r /opt/impacket/requirements.txt
```

4. Change to the "/opt/impact" folder:

```yaml
cd /opt/impacket
```

5. Finally Run the install in that folder:

```yaml
sudo python3 ./setup.py install
```
